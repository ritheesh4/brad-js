1. How to make cursor to position and blink when which the text is inputing through innerHtml method than usual direct mouse clicked keyboard
   entering.

   Solution:
    - The easiet way to add cursor and position the blinking cursor is to keep inputs in textArea instead of normal div.
    - The cursor of textArea appears only when the textArea is focused. So while inserting data into the textArea via innerHtml
      won't work like the way we wanted. At that time, for each insert, foucs() function has to be called. This will easly bring
      the cursor into the correct positon.
    - Adding cursor via css after method will make the things very complicated. If we choose a normal div than a textArea for this application,
      to bring the cursor to the next line while enter button clicked will make lot of messing problemes. textArea is the easiest way to solve this.
