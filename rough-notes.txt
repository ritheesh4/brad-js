- Using ! and tab, simple html template can be implemented.
- The javascript code can be linked to the html file like css files.
- Inside of the <script src ="app.js"><script/>, the location of the script can be mentioned.
- In the browser console, type document and you will get the html file or document of that page.
- document.querySelector('h1').style.color="red". Using this document.querySelector I can       
  change the properties
  of that particular class directly from the console of the browser.
- In the chrome browser, numbers are blue 
  and strings are black.
- The web console can be used for easy fixing and easy  handling of situations


- firstName //Camel case -recommended
  first_name // UnderScore
  FirstName //Pascal case -recommded for ES6 class

- Primitive Data Types:
  Stored directly in the location thd variable accesses Stored on the stack
- Reference Data Types:
  Accessed by Reference
  objets that are stored on the heap
  A pointer to a location in memory
- In js there are 6 primitive data Types
  1. String 
  2. Number 
  3. Boolean
  4. Null
  5. Undefined
  6. Symbols (ES6)

- Reference Data Types/ Objects 
  1. Arrays 
  2. Object Literals
  3. Functions
  4. Dates
  5. Anything Else..

- javscript is a dynamic type language
  - Types are associated with values not variables.
  - The same variable can hold multiple types.
  - We do not need to specify types.
  - Most other languages are statically types (JAVA, C# C++).
  - There are supersets of JS and addons to allow static typing(TypeScript, Flow)

- val = 5;
-console.log(val.toFixed(2));
 - Here toFixed gives the two decimal point values of the number
   
#Video10

- Math Functions
  val = Math.PI;  - pritns pi
  val = Math.E; -prints e
  val = Math.round(2.4); - rounding the number
  val = Math.ceil(2.4); - rounding the number to top, here result would be 3.
  val = Math.floor(2.8); -rounding the nubmer to the bottom, here the result would be 2.
  val = Math.sqrt(64); - finds sqrt
  val = Math.abs(-3); - finding the absolute value. Here that would be 3.
  val = Math.pow(8,2); - finding the the 8 to the power of 2. 64.
  val = Math.min(2,33,4,1,55,3,6,-2); -finding the minimum value.
  val = Math.max(2,33,4,1,55,3,6,-2); -findign the maximum value.
  val = Math.random(); -generate a random number.

  val = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20 + 1); -converts random number which has decimal points to single number which comes under 20.
