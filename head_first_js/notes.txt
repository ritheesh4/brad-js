Meeting notes
-------------
- Type is very important. So keep only the right data types.
- When you asses a progress, go step by step clearly.
- What ever we write inside of a condition, it resovles it to a boolean value.

- Reference Error is and error. But undefined is not an error. It says that that vairalbe is not defined.

- Shadow the global vairalbe means if we declare a local variable with the same name of the global variabl inside of the
  function, that will shadow the global and so that the global vairable will not change. 

- Try to use different names for the local and global varialbe names.
